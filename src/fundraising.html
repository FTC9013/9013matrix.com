      <p>Weâ€™re Team 9013 Matrix â€” a dedicated group of middle and high school students passionate about robotics, innovation, and pushing boundaries. Today (9/25/2025), our team was shaken when one of our teammates was struck by a car while biking to robotics practice.
        Thankfully, they survived and are receiving medical care, but theyâ€™ll be facing a long recovery. This sudden accident has deeply affected our team â€” emotionally and practically â€” just as we prepare for a critical part of our robotics season.
        Weâ€™re asking for help from our extended community to keep our season on track and support our teammate.
        What your donation will help us with:
        Covering additional costs due to the accident (equipment, transportation, etc.),
        Supporting our teammateâ€™s family in any way we can,
        Ensuring our team can still compete at upcoming events,
        Helping replace time and resources lost during this unexpected setback,
        We are more than just a robotics team â€” weâ€™re a family. And right now, one of us is hurting. Weâ€™re doing everything we can to lift each other up and move forward, but we canâ€™t do it alone.
        Even a small donation makes a difference. Please consider helping us get back on our feet.
        Thank you for supporting 9013 Matrix.
        We build more than robots â€” we build resilience. ðŸ’™- 9013 Matrix</p>
        -->
