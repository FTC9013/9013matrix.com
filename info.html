    <h2>Information</h2>
    <h3>About Our Team</h3>
    <p>
        Matrix 9013 is a team that usually houses 7th through 9th graders from Edgewood but we are open to anyone wanting to join. Our team resides in Merritt Island at Merritt Island Highschool, portable 1. Our team includes multiple different sectors or fields of work such as mentoring, electrical, mechanical, and programming. First is an international robotics organization with three different challenges. FTC offers the First Lego League, First Tech Challenge, and First Robotics Competition.
    </p>

    <h3>Team Past</h3>
    <p>
        We had started as 2 Lego Leagues in 2014 called Scrap Metal and Space Chocolate. Scrap Metal and our sister team, Horsepower had eventually merged in order to educate more experienced players and been promoted into a team of the First Tech Challenge. Our name, 9013 Matrix, had come from one of the original mentors of the Lego League, Mrs. Lesie Leutbecker, who currently runs the club.
    </p>

    <h3>Awards</h3>
    <p>We got the Innovation Award 2nd place, Connect Award 3rd place, Winning Alliance Captain, Motivate Award 3rd place, and Control Award 2nd place.</p>

    <h3>Programming</h3>
    <p>Debugging and programming the robot. Starting with html is advised as it helps get the grasp of coding,and scripting. Most programmers enjoy the feel of victory or just finishing a script.</p>

    <h3>Mechanics</h3>
    <p>The team dealing with mechanics are in charge of concepting the design of the robot and building the structure of the robot from the ground up. The team is currently working on prototypes in Onshape. Mechanics also wire and secure connections throughout the frame of the robot, allowing it to use its motors and other mechanisms.</p>

    <h3>Web Design</h3>
    <p>Web design is heavily intertwined with programming. Web designers work on coding Matrixâ€™s website which hosts information on our team, as well as fundraising dates.</p>

    <h3>Game</h3>
    <p>This year's game is where 2 robots face 2 other robots and they try to put artifacts into two towers with holes on top and where the artifacts go down a chamber if they make an artifact go down the tower to get points, this is one match. The two towers are blue and red. The teams are on team red or blue and one robot on team blue will be on team red after round one, same thing for team red.</p>

    <h3>Game times and Points</h3>
    <p>There are 3 time zones in the match called Autonomons, Teleop, and End game. Autonomous is 30 seconds and it's where all robots are in control by pieces of code and 3 points if an artifact goes down the chamber. A motif is plus 2 points artifact 6 total (3 motifs = 1 ranking point). 3 points for leaving the launch zone. lot per overflow artifact (leave and 15 points per motif). Teleop is 2 minutes and robots are controlled by the players. 3 points per artifact in chamber to classifier short random colors. 6 points per motif at the end. 1 point per artifact - overflow. 1 point per artifact in Depart. Teleop is where first 1:00 random artifact and 30 seconds motifs then end game starts. End Game is 20 seconds and it's where the two teams go into a box, completely in is 10 points and partiality in is 5 points. End game is the only time you can go out of 18x18 inches.</p>
